A few Fridays ago, I was at my [favorite bar](http://www.yelp.com/biz/foundation-raleigh) in downtown Raleigh with some friends. We were hanging out and having a casual conversation about startup culture and how it compares to corporate culture. A young guy with a button down shirt and a loosened tie was ordering drinks at the bar and overheard our discussion and introduced himself. His name was Jonathan. He passed his ordered drinks over to his friends and decided to stay and chat with us for a few more moments. Jonathan is 25 and works at a very large local corporation in RTP as a software engineer. He was hired right out of college to write internal code for his company, and he’s doing very well for himself. It came in passing discussion an half hour later that he’s making $80,000+/year (that’s a lot for an entry position here), has a mortgage, a fiancée, and a dog. From the outside looking in, it seems that Jonathan has everything working out for him. I later asked him directly, “…but do you love your job?” He paused, looked down to his drink, and replied, “I love my team, but I f***ing hate my job.” 

Now, this blog post really isn’t meant for everyone. You could be very offended because you like your job, or it’s possible that you can really relate to it. I’ve got friends that work at large companies that absolutely love their job. This isn’t for them. Just ignore this post. This is for the guy who browses [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/) at his cubicle during his break under soul-sucking fluorescent lights. The guy that is sitting back watching the tech world move by while he’s writing code that he hates and spending his days making sure the [TPS reports](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy3rjQGc6lA) are filed correctly. You need to break free, dude. Now is the time to do what you want.

**Your Job is Important** - Let’s face it. Your job is a huge part of your life, though it shouldn’t be confused with your job being your life. If you spend an hour in the morning getting ready for work, a half hour commuting there, a half hour commuting back, and you work 8 hours in one day, then that’s 10 hours of your workday that is devoted to your job. Assuming you get 8 hours of sleep, that leaves you with 6 hours in a day to actually live your life on weekdays. When you wake up, do you look forward to going to work? Are you ready to tackle today’s problems? If the answer is no majority of the time, then it’s time to move on. You know people that work in startups. You’re also aware that in some weeks they work 60+ hours. They might be pulling their hair out some days, but I bet if you chat with them they wouldn’t trade their job to work in a cubicle farm on depressing software.

**Build Something You’re Proud of** - You know that you would rather be creating something. Instead, middle managers want you to make sure the internal reporting software is correctly calculating [bullshit figures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LcjKj8L5-Y) for their bosses. The Java Struts web app that you’re working on needs to be able to support IE 6, especially since you’re not able to install Firefox or Chrome on your locked down desktop. 

You were like me when you were a kid. The action figures sat in the corner, but you were on the floor with your legos. You built things. It’s what you do. You’re a creator. Why not build something you’re proud of? Don’t you want to be one of the developers of an app that is on all of your friends’ smartphones? Don’t you want to “[wire in](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c0lk-LtLI0)” one day and get lost in your project?

**The Time is Right** - Some say we’re in a bubble, and we’ll all be without jobs soon. They say that we’re heading for a Web 2.0 dot com bust like we had last decade. That topic can be debated for hours alone, but one thing is for sure: we’re in unprecedented times. There has never been a time in history where a few people with laptops in coffee shops can create an online empire. Never before have people been able to create wildly profitable and highly valuable companies with little funds.

**Job Security is a Myth** - I’ve only been programming professionally for a few years, but I’ve learned that [all jobs are temporary](http://www.ericboggs.com/blog/2011/10/23/the-risky-start-up-myth.html). That cushy job you have that pays for your nice car and mortgage can easily disappear with budget cuts. Those certificates that you’ve been working on for internal promotions probably won’t be valuable at the next company you apply to. You could be laid off with the [25% of your company](http://wraltechwire.com/business/tech_wire/opinion/blogpost/10866724/) even if it gets acquired. 

Shit happens. Jobs come and go. Why not let shit happen while you’re doing something you love? 

**But I Like My Paycheck** - Don’t let society pressure you into thinking that a corporate job is better than a startup job. When I studied CS at UNC, it was kind of assumed that you would go write software for some large company. I recall looking at a slide that compared salaries of different job sectors in the tech field. All the web jobs were at the bottom of the list. Sure, that may have been true 5-10 years ago, but having a job at a smaller company can be very rewarding financially and mentally. The problems at some web companies are just as difficult or harder than the ones people solve in office parks. There’s also a chance (though much smaller) that you’ll be able to retire on the equity you earn.

**Everyone is Hiring** - [Seriously](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3652041). At least it feels that way. Even in the [Triangle](http://triangletechtalk.com/jobboard/). Money is flowing into tech. I would love to see an unemployment statistic of coders vs. every other occupation. I’m willing to wager that it’s under 3%. If you’re unemployed, not making rent, but can code, then you’re doing something wrong. The [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303772904577336230132805276.html?mod=e2tw) just name “Software Engineer” as the best job of 2012. They measured “physical demands, work environment, income, stress, and hiring outlook.” If it’s the best job in America, it’s easier than ever to find another job, but you hate your job, why are you still there? 

Do yourself a favor. Go hack on something this weekend. Create a pull request on Github. If you’re in a city that does [Startup Weekend](http://startupweekend.org/), go participate. There’s one this weekend in Raleigh, NC. Life’s too short to be creating shitty software.
